# Advertising Campaign Analysis Using R

This project evaluates the effectiveness of a travel agency's retargeting campaign by analyzing purchase behavior across treatment and control groups.

##  Objective
To determine whether the retargeting campaign increased the likelihood of purchase and identify the overall impact using statistical analysis.

##  Key Tasks
- Performed data cleaning by matching datasets with multiple keys (Email, Contact_Phone, Incoming_Phone) to address missing values and duplicates.
- Built linear and logistic regression models to estimate campaign effectiveness.
- Added interaction terms to test personalized retargeting impacts.

##  Tools & Techniques
- R (tidyverse, broom, caret)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Hypothesis Testing
- Data Visualization (ggplot2)

##  Results
- The retargeted group showed a **5.86% increase in purchase likelihood** (*p < 0.05*).
- Actionable recommendations for improving retargeting strategy.

##  Files Included
- `Advertising_Campaign_Analysis.R` â€“ Main R script with data cleaning and modeling steps.
- `datasets/sample_data.csv` â€“ Small anonymized sample.
- `output/` â€“ Plots and summary tables (PNG / CSV).

##  Data Note
Full dataset is not provided due to privacy/confidentiality. A small sample file is included to demonstrate code functionality.
