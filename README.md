# Advertising Campaign Analysis Using R

This project evaluates the effectiveness of a travel agency's **retargeting campaign** by analyzing purchase behavior across treatment and control groups.  
It applies statistical and machine learning techniques in R to determine how advertising impacts purchase likelihood.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To measure whether the retargeting campaign increased the likelihood of purchase and to identify key factors influencing conversion.

---

## 🧩 Key Tasks
- Performed **data cleaning** by matching datasets using multiple keys (Email, Contact_Phone, Incoming_Phone) to handle missing values and duplicates.  
- Built **linear and logistic regression** models to estimate campaign effectiveness.  
- Added **interaction terms** to test personalized retargeting impacts.  
- Generated insights for actionable recommendations to improve marketing strategy.
